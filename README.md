# dbnapp.github.io
A site all about me

## Goals
* Make site
* Keep it simple, responsive
* Showcase other github projects
* Learn more css stuff

## Decisions
* Using skeletal because I want to see what I can do without depending on a big library/framework
* JS, right now no plans for it. I want to see how much I can accomplish without it.
