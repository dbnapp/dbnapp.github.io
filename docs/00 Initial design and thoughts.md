# Whats this?

These docs are just going to serve as a mixture of things. Design decisions, but also maybe some personal thoughts. If you've found yourself here, please enjoy this little journal (or journ*ey*).

# Motivation

It's my site. Again. 2025 Edition. I've never been satisfied with my site. It was functional but I never felt like it showed off something about me. This time I really wanted to focus on capturing a "vibe". Lately I find myself often returning to the past. Seeking retro footage and aesthetics. Maybe having kids has made me reflect on the joys of my childhood.

One of my favorite discoveries of the past few years has been city pop. It just brings me a serene nostalgic feeling. Thats what I wanted to capture with this site. It's how I'm feeling right now, it's a glimpse of who I am.

# First draft

https://www.figma.com/design/eK6mooSmzMCeuxINuGFRoe/dbnapp.com?node-id=0-1

I basically started with that gif in the background. I love the colors of the sunset and the ocean. It's from some anime but I never looked it up. I used AI to upscale it. I'm no artist! I didn't really have a plan around this site other than the aesthetic. My only requirements were:

- show some basic info about myself
- share links to my stuff
- showcase projects (lol)
- have city pop music
- nice to have some animation

I left a lot of blanks to be filled in. Eventually I came upon the idea of a greeting / postcard. City pop and the beach are very closely tied to a "vacation" vibe. It feels like somewhere far away. Somewhere peaceful and familiar. This allowed me to put a spin on my usual "about me" blurb and write it as if I was writing to someone on a postcard. I thought this was pretty clever!

As for how to showcase projects idk I thought maybe they could fly out of an envelope? I haven't thought that far ahead. I also need to figure out how to make a postcard work on mobile. I was thinking of just animating it left to right as you scroll, but I feel like that wouldn't feel intuitive.
